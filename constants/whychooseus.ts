        "By giving users ownership of the protocol, Usual ensures value circulates within the community, not just among a few. Every dollar in the system builds real, shared rewards, with 90% of value going back to users. Usual turns users into owners, creating a new, equitable approach to stablecoins and token-based finance.",
